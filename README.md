# 🩺 DriftCare NG - Next-Gen Health Intelligence

DriftCare NG is a premium, AI-powered health monitoring and "drift detection" platform designed to help users track their adaptive capacity and detect subtle shifts in their health patterns before they become critical issues. Built specifically with localized health contexts (such as Lagos, Nigeria) in mind, it combines modern data visualization with an intuitive AI health companion.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Advanced Health Analytics
